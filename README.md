# Gabus-tranlate: Real-Time Translation App

**Custom Hook Architecture:** Logic for data fetching, loading states, and error handling is cleanly isolated within custom React Hooks.
* **Performance Optimization (Debounce):** Integrated a **custom debounce hook** to dramatically reduce unnecessary API calls while the user types, ensuring the application is efficient and cost-effective.
* **API Consumption:** Implemented robust handling of a third-party translation API (Google Translate).

**Test the application here:** https://gabuudev.github.io/gabus-react-translator/
